\section*{Objectives}

The objectives of this project are to:

\begin{itemize}

    \item study the expected payoff structure of repeated games with mistakes using the prisoner's dilemma as a model game.
    \item design an algorithm for efficiently computing the expected payoff of each player in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with mistakes.
    \item learn about tools to speed up numerical calculations in Python such as profiling and multiprocessing.
    \item study strategies that 'count' particular outcomes and how they perform in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with mistakes.

\end{itemize}
